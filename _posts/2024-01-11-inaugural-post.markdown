# Hello world!

I wanted to write an awesome first post to kick off into the great and vast web.  But try as I might, I couldn't come up with an awesome topic that also felt introductory.  So instead, I'll just share an anecdote about the tagline of my site. 

When I was young, my family would often take road trips for vacation.  On those trips, we would listen to audio tapes - yes, cassettes - that ranged from music, to books, to old radio shows.  

The radio shows were fun.  As much as all of these were audiotory forms of media, the old timey radio show was a story-telling production dedicated to the type of audience in which I found myself: a captive audience (stuck in the family vehicle for hours), huddling around the radio, shushing each other so we wouldn't miss a line.

One of the family favorites was a show called Fibber McGee and Molly.  It was a WWII era sitcom, and featured a cast of recurring characters.  One such, the Old Timer, would often follow a trope-like interaction with the main cast.  Often after hearing some character talk about a recent happening, he'd wheeze out

> That ain't the way I hear'd [note: procounced "hear-ed"] it.  The way I hear'd it, one feller says to th' other feller, he says, ...

and launch into his own story that may or may not have been at all related to what he'd just heard.  By today's standards, it may not be very funny, but that was 1940s humor I guess.

Anyway, those sentences became a household staple during my childhood (well, for *my* household).  We could get a smile from another family member by, after someone else was retelling some part of their day, responding  with "that ain't the way I hear'd it", and then tell about our day.

And so, with that trope still ringing in my ears some decades later, it seemed appropriate as a blog title.  Is it witty?  Only if you get the reference... and now, hopefully you do.  Welcome to

## The way I heard it
